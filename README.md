# Network-Design-GNS3
Network topologies simulation and analysis using GNS3, including star, mesh, bus, and ring configurations.

## Introduction
This project focuses on using GNS3, a network simulation tool that emulates real network devices and configurations. It provides a virtual environment for testing and learning about different network topologies.

## Why Use GNS3
- **Cost-effective**: No need for physical hardware.
- **Safe environment**: Test configurations without risk.
- **Flexible**: Supports various network topologies and devices.
- **Educational**: Ideal for learning and practicing networking skills.

### Advantages and Disadvantages
#### Advantages
- Realistic network simulations.
- Extensive device support.
- Integration with real hardware.
- User-friendly interface.

#### Disadvantages
- Requires powerful hardware for complex simulations.
- Can be complex to set up initially.
- Limited support for some proprietary network devices.

### Comparison with Other Simulation Tools
- **GNS3 vs. Cisco Packet Tracer**: GNS3 supports real device images and is more realistic, while Packet Tracer is easier to use but limited to Cisco devices.
- **GNS3 vs. VMware**: GNS3 focuses on network simulation, whereas VMware is a general virtualization tool not specific to networking.
- **GNS3 vs. EVE-NG**: GNS3 is free and open-source with strong community support, while EVE-NG offers more features in its paid versions and integrated labs.

## Network Topologies
This project includes the design and implementation of the following topologies in GNS3:
- **Mesh Topology**: Each device connects to every other device, providing high redundancy and fault tolerance.
- **Ring Topology**: Devices connect in a circular manner, each linked to two others, ensuring equal network access but vulnerable to single point failures.
- **Star Topology**: Multiple devices connect to a central switch, which is easy to manage but has a single point of failure.
- **Bus Topology**: Devices connect along a single communication line, making it simple and cost-effective but prone to data collisions.

### Complex Network Architecture
The project also includes the design of a complex network architecture for an organization, combining multiple topologies and various network devices (routers, switches, servers). It involves:
- Defining a comprehensive IP addressing scheme.
- Using protocols like TCP/IP, DHCP, and DNS.

## Protocols Used
- **Internet Protocol (IP)**: Handles addressing and routing of data packets (IPv4).
- **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)**: Matches IP addresses to MAC addresses.
- **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)**: Sends error messages and operational information.
- **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**: Ensures reliable data transmission.
- **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**: Allows faster data transmission without error checking.

## Network Analysis with Wireshark
Wireshark is used to capture and analyze network packets, monitor packet flow, and diagnose connectivity issues, confirming the effectiveness of GNS3 simulations.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the practical application of GNS3 in designing and testing various network topologies. GNS3 provides a valuable platform for learning and experimenting with network configurations, offering a realistic and flexible environment for both educational and professional purposes.

## Future Work
Future work could involve more complex network setups and exploring additional features and integrations available in GNS3.
